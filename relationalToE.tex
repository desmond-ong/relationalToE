%you could say that there's simple ``bob feels E" and relational ``bob feels E about X" type emotion attributions, where E is an emotion and X is an event. there are two questions to address: what is the relation between the two types of attribution, and what is the relation between two relational ones, depending on the relation between the events.


In our daily lives, we constantly interact with others around us, and invariably have to reason about others' emotional states. There are two classes of intuitive attributions than observers often make, the first being simple emotional state attributions -- ``Bob feels happy (in general)". Some affective scientists might point out that in the absence of  The second class of emotional state attributions are relational in nature: ``Bob feels happy about X", where X can be an event like ``receiving a promotion" or ``seeing his children". 

	Relational attributions are justifiable according to some lay causal theory. Intuitively, emotions must be ``caused" by some event in the world, and 


Observers have a lay theory that something Lay observers often attribute emotions 
	Indeed, affective and cognitive scientists have debated for decades over whether 


Lay theory:
Emotion attribution is a function $E$ that takes the agent $A$, the event $X$, and returns a real-valued number. That is, $E(A,X)$ returns the emotions attributed to agent $A$ following event $X$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Question 1: What is the relation between two relational attributions? Given events $X$ and $Y$ that occur to an agent $A$, how does an observer compute $E(A,X)$ and $E(A,Y)$: do they depend on each other?
\item Question 2: What is the relation between relational and simple emotion attribution. That is, how does $E(A)$ depend on $E(A,X)$ and $E(A,Y)$.
\end{itemize}



Results:
\begin{itemize}
\item No Crosstalk: Ps can separate emotions attributed to event X and Y. i.e. $E(A,X)$ is independent of $Y$.
\item Effect of expectations. Even though there's no cross-talk, the mere existence of the second event affects the features of X (removes loss aversion). The existence of $Y$ qualitatively changes $\mathscr{F}(X)$.
\item No Loss Aversion. In judging emotions across multiple events, people expect no loss aversion.
\item Temporal order matters. Participants' lay theories are sensitive to the temporal ordering of events: if $X$ happened, then $Y$ happened, $Y$ matters more to overall emotion $E(A)$.
\item Evidence presentation order matters (recency effect). The order in which participants make attributions also affects: if they first make an attribution to a temporally later event $Y$ then to a temporally earlier event $X$, their judgments about overall emotion $E(A)$ would not favor the later event $Y$. The attribution that the participant most recently gave is weighed more.

revisit analysis based on hypotheses of these components

look at a "first-half, last-half" analysis. It's a somewhat hard experiment, maybe Ss are getting tired or bored.

\section{Behavioral Experiments}

\subsection{Basic Paradigm Description}
The basic experimental paradigm across all experiments described in this paper involves watching a character play a spinning wheel. The characters spun wheels and ostensibly won an amount of money depending on where each wheel landed (Fig. \ref{ParadigmFig}). Each wheel comprised three possible outcomes, all of which were non-negative. We systematically de-correlated the probabilities of the outcomes and the values of the outcomes of each wheel, allowing for separate calculation of reward amount and expected value (the probability-weighted averaged reward).

In our previous work (Ong, Zaki, \& Goodman, under review), we analyzed how the parameters of a single situation $X$ affect participant judgments of emotions to an agent $A$, or $E(A,X)$. That is, what are the features of the situation $X$, $\mathscr{F}(X)$, that reliably predict $E(A,X)$. We identified three predictors that consistently and significantly predicted all the emotions we measured: the amount won (win($X$)), the prediction error (PE($X$) = amount won - expected value of $X$), and the absolute value of the prediction error (absPE($X$)). The first two are naturally predicted from standard utility theory. The third predictor indicates that participants' sensitivity to negative prediction errors were stronger than to positive prediction errors, indicating a measurable indicator of \textit{loss aversion} (cites).\footnote{The PE, absPE formulation is mathematically equivalent to the more common, piecewise formulation of loss aversion: $y=a PE, PE \geq 0$ and $y=b PE, PE < 0$. In our model, we require just one equation across the whole domain, $y=c PE + d |PE|$. We can easily show that $a = c + d$, and $b = c Ð d$.} Using the formulation we had above, we built a regression model to predict emotion attribution following an event $X$: 
\begin{align}
E(A,X) &= E(A,\mathscr{F}(X)) \nonumber \\
&= b_0 + b_1 \text{win}(X) + b_2 \text{PE}(X) + b_3 \text{absPE}(X) + \epsilon
\end{align}
Thus, we had a predefined analysis plan for analyzing the experiments in this paper.



\subsection{Experiment 1}
\subsubsection{Participants.} We recruited XXX hundred participants through AmazonÕs Mechanical Turk and paid them for completing the experiment. All experiments reported in this paper were conducted according to guidelines approved by the Institutional Review Board at Stanford University.

\subsubsection{Procedures.} Participants played the role of observers and watched characters play a simple gambling game, described above (see Fig. \ref{ParadigmFig}). On each trial, each character played 2 wheels. The wheels were spun consecutively. After each wheel, participants gave ratings of how the character feels, using six different Likert scales, for each of six different emotions: happiness, sadness, contentment, disappointment, relief and regret. After they gave ratings to the second wheel, they were asked for an overall judgment of the character's emotions. Thus, on each trial, participants had to make 3 emotion attributions: one after the result of each wheel, and one overall. Each participant completed 5 trials.


%We pre-generated a total of 50 scenarios, where each scenario corresponds to a particular outcome on a particular wheel. On each trial, the experimental program selected the scenario (the particular outcome to be won) randomly from the total set of 50 scenarios, and not proportional to the sector size within a wheel . This was a design choice to ensure that small sectors (with low notational probability) were equally represented in the data. This fact was not obvious to the participants, and we assume that participants treated the wheel as being fairly spun. The exact position within the sector where the spinner landsÑfor example, whether the spinner lands in the center of the sector, or near the edge of the sector, as in the example shown in Figure 3Ñwas drawn from a uniform distribution.

%When human observers attribute emotions to others, they are often doing so with respect to

%Social life constantly requires us to decipher information about others into inferences about their emotional states: for example, we have to reason about what makes our romantic partners happy (a surprise gift?) or angry (not doing one's chores?), and what they would do in those emotional states, in order to plan our upcoming interactions. Such \textit{affective cognition}, or our ability to reason about others' emotions, scaffolds everything from cooperation to the maintenance of social relationships. Affective cognition lies in the intersection of two foundational social cognitive topics, Theory of Mind (ToM; the ability to reason about others' mental states) and Empathy (the ability to feel and understand others' emotions). Although the past decade has seen much progress in understanding ToM and empathy using neuroscience \cite{Koster-Hale2013, Zaki2012}, developmental \cite{Meltzoff2011}, and computational \cite{Baker2009, Goodman2013} approaches, somewhat less attention has been paid specifically to affective cognition and some of its foundational cognitive questions. How do we represent (cognitively and neurally) others' emotional states? How do we reason with those representations? How do we make predictions and inferences about others' future actions or desires based on their emotions? Finally, how does affective cognition shift across development? The aim of the symposium is to answer these, and other relevant questions, at the forefront of this field.

%Humans are extremely skilled at reasoning about othersÕ emotions; this ability is crucially important to forming and maintaining social relationships. Yet despite its importance, few formal or quantitative theories have successfully described how affective cognition operates. Here we address this gap by constructing a computational model, drawing on tools from Bayesian statistics. We use a simple gambling paradigm to quantitatively test this model, finding that emotion judgments are well explained in terms of a low-dimensional representation based on value-related computations. Further, we demonstrate that emotion inferences across multiple situations are tightly predicted by BayesÕ rule. Our results speak to a deep structural relationship between emotions and cognitive inference, and suggest wide-ranging applications to basic psychological theory and psychiatry.

e.g. SpinnerID_1: A, SpinnerID_2: B

leftWheelFirst==1:
	A drawn on Left, B drawn on Right
	Asked about Left wheel First [spinner A]
	Chronologically-first data [Left Wheel, A] goes into emotion1array


	A == asked first
	B == asked second
	emotion1array == LEFT wheel: A
	emotion2array == RIGHT wheel: B
	spinnerID_1: matched with emotion1array
	spinnerID_2: matched with emotion2array
	


leftWheelFirst==0:
	B drawn on Left, A drawn on Right
	Asked about Right wheel First [spinner A]
	Chronologically-first data [Right Wheel, A] goes into emotion2array

	A == asked first
	B == asked second
	emotion1array == LEFT wheel: B
	emotion2array == RIGHT wheel: A
